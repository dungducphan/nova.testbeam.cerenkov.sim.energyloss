Find out how to make VPT material for the TOF

Figure out a better way to run beam macro

Record position of beam on first TOF and second TOF, record percentage of beam splitting from 2nd TOF to 1st, and premade gaussian of the beam from macro

Record Energy loss for each size of TOF and beam spread


2.54 in to cm



Just world simulation has TOF as sensitive detector, but it is just air.
